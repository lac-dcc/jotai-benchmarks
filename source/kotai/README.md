# Kotai

## Dependencies

### Required:
* Python 3.10[\*](#WhyModernPython) (if your OS/distro doesn't use it by default, check pyenv below)
* Valgrind 3.17 compiled with [CFGgrind](https://github.com/rimsa/CFGgrind#building)
* A working build of [Jotai](http://cuda.dcc.ufmg.br:8080/jcoelho/jotai#building-the-project)
* Clang

### Recommended:
* [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation)
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installation) (master, not 1.1)

## Setup

### 1. From source, enter the project directory

```zsh
cd kotai
```

### 2. Check if you're running Python 3.10

```zsh
python --version
```
>  <pre>Python 3.10.0</pre>

### 3. \[Optional\] Create and activate a virtualenv (strongly suggested)

Follow the instructions below according to whether you installed the optional dependencies

<hr>

#### üáµ‚ÄÉIf you're using pyenv and Poetry

Fetch project dependencies and create virtualenv
```zsh
poetry install
```
Activate virtualenv
```zsh
poetry shell
```

To check if it worked, this:
```zsh
poetry env info
```
should output something like this:
>  <pre>
>  Virtualenv
>  Python:         <strong>3.10.0</strong>
>  Implementation: CPython
>  Path:           /home/condekind/repos/<strong>kotai/.venv</strong>
>  Valid:          True
>  
>  System
>  Platform: linux
>  OS:       posix
>  Python:   /home/condekind/.local/share/pyenv/versions/3.10.0</pre>

<hr>

#### ‚õî‚ÄÉIf you're not using pyenv and Poetry

Create virtualenv
```zsh
# Change "python" below to your python3.10 binary if 3.10 is not your default
python -m venv .venv
```
Activate virtualenv
```zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

To check if it worked, this:
```zsh
which python && "$(which python)" --version
```
should output something like this:
>  <pre>
>  /home/condekind/repos/kotai/<strong>.venv/bin/python</strong>
>  Python <strong>3.10.0</strong></pre>

### 4. Locate Jotai

Create a link to the directory in which you built Jotai at the root of the repo. For this early version it's important that the link is called _build_, but the code for accepting other names is already [baked in](#ChangeJotaiPath).
<pre>
ln -sfiT ../jotai/build build && realpath -eL build/lib/Jotai
</pre>

## Usage

### Options

```zsh
python kotai -h
```
>  <pre>
>  usage: python -m kotai [-h] [-c] -i INPUTDIR [INPUTDIR ...] [-j NPROC] [-J CHUNKSIZE] [-K {int-bounds,big-arr,big-arr-10x,all}] [-L LOGFILE]
>  
>  Jotai options
>  
>  options:
>    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
>    -c, --clean
>    -i INPUTDIR [INPUTDIR ...], --inputdir INPUTDIR [INPUTDIR ...]
>    -j NPROC, --nproc NPROC
>    -J CHUNKSIZE, --chunksize CHUNKSIZE
>    -K {int-bounds,big-arr,big-arr-10x,all}
>    -L LOGFILE, --logfile LOGFILE</pre>

### Running one example with one *constraint* type

```zsh
python kotai -m -K big-arr -i folder_with_program/
```

### Cleaning the generated files

```zsh
python kotai --clean - folder_with_program/
```

### Running on 70k functions with all *constraint* types on 16 cores

```zsh
mkdir -p tmp
```
```zsh
curl -s http://cuda.dcc.ufmg.br/angha/files/functions/seed-from-530k-functions.tar.gz | tar xvz -C tmp
```
```zsh
python -m kotai -j 16 -K all -i tmp/seed_fns
```

### Viewing results
After Kotai is done running, a message should display the number of benchmarks that executed without undefined behaviors. The CFGgring results with Dynamic and Static instructions count can be found inside util/output.
The information mapping constraints to a switch number can be found inside /output. The return value of the programs can also be found in /output. 
<br />
As for the generated benhcmarks, inside the input folder with the original programs there will be a new folder benchmark_name.d for each program inside the input directory. If a final benchmark was produced for this program, it will be inside its corresponding .d folder along with the binaries and the CFG files created during the process.


### Checking progress

Limited logging functionality is available, and will be expanded in the future. For the time being, the default logfile is `output/jotai.log`, opened in "append" mode.

## Troubleshoot

### I'm using pyenv and Poetry, but my virtualenv's Python version is wrong

This could have many causes. Check if <code>$POETRY_HOME/venv/bin/python</code> is a symlink to <code>$PYENV_ROOT/versions/3.10.0/bin/python</code>. If it's not, follow the instructions below.

Try this:
- Get pyenv working normally (read the instructions in their repo to make sure their python wrapper appears in your path before you default python. You have to logout and login for the PATH change to apply, if you're following the default instructions. Switching users won't do! It has to be a logout or reboot.

- [Uninstall poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry#installation)

- Set your global python version to 3.10 with pyenv
```zsh
pyenv global 3.10.0
```

- Reopen your terminal

- Double check if your version is 3.10 and `python` references pyenv's shim
```zsh
python --version && which python
```

>  <pre>
>  Python 3.10.0
>  /home/condekind/.local/share/pyenv/shims/python</pre>

- Install poetry again

- If <code>$POETRY_HOME/venv/bin/python</code> points to <code>$PYENV_ROOT/versions/3.10.0/bin/python</code>, the problem should be fixed.

  <summary>üå∂Ô∏è</summary>
  
  > In theory, the project's virtualenv is the only one that has to be running 3.10. However, before 3.10 went stable there were strange issues trying to use pyenv's `python` shim (3.10rc*X*, defined by a local .python-version) as base for creating the virtualenv. It might've been an issue with the 3.10.0rc*X* pre-release string, but Poetry was ignoring the fact that running `python` at that directory should use whatever version <code>.../pyenv/shims/python</code> would report. Poetry instead linked 3.9 in .venv/bin, which was both the system default and the version Poetry was installed with).
